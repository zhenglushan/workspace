"""network configuration

This module provides network drivers and routing configuration. To use this
module, a MicroPython variant/build with network capabilities must be installed.
Network drivers for specific hardware are available within this module and are
used to configure hardware network interface(s). Network services provided
by configured interfaces are then available for use via the :mod:`usocket`
module.

For example::

    # connect/ show IP config a specific network interface
    # see below for examples of specific drivers
    import network
    import utime
    nic = network.Driver(...)
    if not nic.isconnected():
        nic.connect()
        print("Waiting for connection...")
        while not nic.isconnected():
            utime.sleep(1)
    print(nic.ifconfig())

    # now use usocket as usual
    import usocket as socket
    addr = socket.getaddrinfo('micropython.org', 80)[0][-1]
    s = socket.socket()
    s.connect(addr)
    s.send(b'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: micropython.org\r\n\r\n')
    data = s.recv(1000)
    s.close()
